					<p> As a passionate and driven Computer Engineering graduate student at Wright State University, I am excited to share my journey and experiences that have shaped my academic and professional aspirations. My educational background began with a Bachelor’s in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Rajamahendri Institute of Engineering and Technology in India, where I developed a solid foundation in technology and engineering principles.</p>
					
					<p>Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s degree with a GPA of 3.5/4, focusing on expanding my technical skills in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. I have engaged in various projects that not only challenged me but also allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world problems. For instance, I developed a GAN Defense Mechanism using advanced technologies like PyTorch and TensorFlow, and created a Face Recognition App utilizing Python and OpenCV. These projects reflect my commitment to continuous learning and innovation.</p>
					
					<p>In addition to my technical pursuits, I value teamwork and community engagement. I have taken on leadership roles, such as hosting the Festival of Lights Event for the International Students Association at Wright State University, where I coordinated a team of 15 volunteers. My volunteer work with organizations like the Sneha Foundation has further enriched my understanding of social responsibility. As I continue my journey in computer engineering, I am eager to leverage my skills in data science through ongoing certifications, including a course from Scaler. I believe that my blend of technical expertise, leadership experience, and dedication to community service positions me well for future challenges in the tech industry.</p>

					<p><a href="https://github.com/JahnaviYerroju/GAN">GAN Defense Mechanism:</a><br>
					Developed a defense mechanism using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to combat adversarial attacks, specifically employing the Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Implemented the GAN architecture in Python with PyTorch and TensorFlow, enhancing model robustness. Evaluated accuracy improvements in a classifier against adversarial examples, demonstrating the effectiveness of GANs in mitigating adversarial effects.</p>

					<p><a href="https://github.com/JahnaviYerroju/ARCHITECTURAL-MODEL-OF-BUS-STOP">ARCHITECTURAL MODEL OF A BUS STOP WITH AUTOMATIC SUNSHADE:</a><br>
					The architectural model of a bus stop with automatic sunshade is a new generation bus stop. Here, the roof moves with respect to sun direction, and expands during rains. This will make the bus stop comfortable for passengers without any climatic problems. The automatic lights are installed so people can use the bus stop during nights without any fear. This model satisfies modern technology.</p>

					<p>MANHOLE MONITORING WITH FAULT DETECTION AND REPORTING SYSTEM:<br>
					A smart city is the future goal to have cleaner and better amenities for the society. Smart underground infrastructure is an important feature to be considered while implementing a smart city. Drainage system monitoring plays a vital role in keeping the city clean and healthy. Since manual monitoring is incompetent, this leads to slow handling of problems in drainage and consumes more time to solve.</p>
